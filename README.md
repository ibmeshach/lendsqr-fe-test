# Lendsqr Frontend Engineering Assessment - Ibadin Meshach Eidenehi

## Project Overview

Welcome to my submission for the Lendsqr frontend engineering assessment. This project demonstrates my expertise in developing a responsive web application using React with TypeScript and SCSS. Below are the key aspects of the project:

## Project Details

### Pages Implemented

1. **Login Page**

   - Designed for secure user authentication with a clear and intuitive UI.
   - Implemented form validation and error handling for a seamless user experience.

2. **Dashboard**

   - Developed a dynamic dashboard displaying key metrics and data relevant to user activities.
   - Utilized React components to visualize data effectively and ensure responsiveness across devices.

3. **User Page**

   - Integrated a mock API to fetch and display a list of users.
   - Implemented pagination for efficient data loading and browsing.

4. **User Details Page**
   - Designed a detailed view for individual user profiles, leveraging local storage for persistent data storage.

### Key Features Implemented

- **Visual Fidelity**: Ensured that the application closely adheres to the design specifications provided in Figma. This includes layout, styling, typography, and color schemes, maintaining a consistent visual identity throughout.

- **Data Management**: Utilized mock APIs and local storage to simulate real-world data scenarios. This approach ensures seamless data handling and persistence, enhancing user interaction and workflow continuity.

- **Responsiveness**: Developed the application to be fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes. Applied CSS media queries and responsive design principles to optimize user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Testing**: Implemented unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library to validate the functionality of components and ensure code reliability. Tests cover positive and negative scenarios to maintain robustness and stability.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React for building interactive and scalable user interfaces.
- **Language**: TypeScript for type-safe and maintainable codebase, improving development efficiency and reducing errors.
- **Styling**: SCSS for enhanced CSS preprocessing capabilities, facilitating modular and reusable stylesheets.
